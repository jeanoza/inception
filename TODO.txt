1. Why doesn't work `service mysql start`?
	- when mount volume with:  -v $(pwd)/srcs/requirements/mariadb/db_vol:/var/lib/mysql
	- Problem is when `docker run` with `-v (host_dir):(cont_dir)`:
		- docker doesn't copy files in /var/lib/mysql to host_dir
		- but, create host_dir(empty) then link this empty folder to /var/lib/mysql
		=> so, /var/lib/mysql become EMPTY!!

	=> HOW TO FIX THIS PROBLEME??!
